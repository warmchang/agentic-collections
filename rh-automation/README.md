# Red Hat Automation Agentic Plugin

Automation governance for Ansible Automation Platform. 11 skills and 4 reference docs that audit AAP configuration against Red Hat best practices, run governed execution with check mode and rollback, and perform forensic failure analysis with error classification.

**Persona**: Red Hat Automation Governance Architect
**Marketplaces**: Claude Code, Cursor

## What This Adds Over Raw MCP Tools

Raw MCP access lets an agent list templates, launch jobs, and read events. This collection adds:

1. **Knowledge** -- 4 docs distilling 8+ official Red Hat sources, read and cited at runtime
2. **Judgment** -- 8 skills that interpret MCP data through Red Hat best practices (risk classification, error taxonomy, governance assessment)
3. **Workflow** -- 3 orchestration skills that chain other skills with human-in-the-loop controls

All recommendations cite specific Red Hat documentation (chapter and section).

## Three Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Governance Assessment

> "Assess my AAP platform's governance readiness for production use."

The agent audits 7 governance domains across all 6 AAP MCP servers, producing a PASS/GAP/WARN report with Red Hat citations per finding. Domains: Workflow Governance, Notification Coverage, RBAC, Credential Security, Execution Environments, Workload Isolation, Audit Trail.

**Entry point**: `governance-assessor` | **Key skill**: `governance-readiness-assessor` | **Doc**: `governance-readiness.md`

### Use Case 2: Governed Execution

> "Execute the security patch on production urgently."

The agent classifies inventory risk, scans extra_vars for secrets, runs check mode before execution, and requires approval for production targets. Catches failures in dry run before they cause outages.

**Entry point**: `governance-executor` | **Key skills**: `execution-risk-analyzer`, `governed-job-launcher` | **Doc**: `execution-governance.md`

### Use Case 3: Forensic Troubleshooting

> "Job #4451 failed. What happened?"

The agent extracts failure events, classifies errors (Platform/Code/Configuration), correlates with host system facts, and provides Red Hat documentation-backed resolution recommendations.

**Entry point**: `forensic-troubleshooter` | **Key skills**: `job-failure-analyzer`, `host-fact-inspector`, `resolution-advisor` | **Docs**: `job-troubleshooting.md`, `error-classification.md`
