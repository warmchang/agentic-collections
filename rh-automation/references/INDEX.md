# Documentation Index

Navigation guide for the rh-automation knowledge base. Runtime copies live under each skill's `references/` directory (canonical files plus shared-pool symlinks). This pack index maps those files for repository navigation.

## How Documents Are Used

```
User Request → Agent → Skill reads document → Skill queries MCP tools → Skill interprets with document knowledge → Output with Red Hat citations
```

Paths in `.ai-index/` are pack-relative (from `rh-automation/`).

## Semantic Indexing

The `.ai-index/` directory contains pre-computed indexes for efficient document discovery:

- `semantic-index.json` -- Document metadata with semantic keywords
- `task-to-docs-mapping.json` -- Pre-computed document sets for common workflows
- `cross-reference-graph.json` -- Document relationship graph
