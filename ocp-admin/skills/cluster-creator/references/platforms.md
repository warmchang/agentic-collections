# OpenShift Platform Types

Overview of different OpenShift deployment models and their characteristics.

---

## Overview

OpenShift comes in multiple deployment models, each optimized for specific use cases and operational models.

**Platform Types**:
- **OCP (OpenShift Container Platform)** - Self-managed on any infrastructure
- **SNO (Single-Node OpenShift)** - Compact deployment for edge/development
- **OSD (OpenShift Dedicated)** - Managed service on AWS/GCP
- **ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS)** - AWS-native managed service
- **ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift)** - Azure-native managed service

**API Access by Platform Type**:

The `cluster-inventory` skill uses different Red Hat APIs depending on the platform type:

| Platform Type | Management Model | API Endpoint | API Path |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| **OCP** | Self-managed | Assisted Installer | `/api/assisted-install/v2` |
| **SNO** | Self-managed | Assisted Installer | `/api/assisted-install/v2` |
| **ROSA** | Managed Service | OCM (Clusters Management) | `/api/clusters_mgmt/v1` |
| **ARO** | Managed Service | OCM (Clusters Management) | `/api/clusters_mgmt/v1` |
| **OSD** | Managed Service | OCM (Clusters Management) | `/api/clusters_mgmt/v1` |

**Note**: The `cluster-inventory` skill automatically queries BOTH APIs and merges results to provide a unified view of all your OpenShift clusters regardless of type.

## OCP (OpenShift Container Platform)

**Type**: Self-managed

**Description**: Full OpenShift deployment that you install and manage yourself on your chosen infrastructure.

**Deployment Models**:
- **High-Availability (HA)**: 3+ control plane nodes, 2+ worker nodes
- **Compact Cluster**: 3 control plane nodes (also workers), 0 dedicated workers
- **Single-Node OpenShift (SNO)**: See dedicated section below

**Infrastructure Support**:
- Bare metal
- VMware vSphere
- Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)
- Nutanix AHV
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) via IPI

**Management Responsibility**:
- ✅ You manage: Infrastructure, cluster lifecycle, upgrades, scaling
- ❌ Red Hat provides: Software updates, security patches, documentation

**Advantages**:
- Full control over infrastructure and configuration
- Deploy anywhere (on-premises, cloud, edge)
- Custom networking and storage
- Air-gapped deployment support
- Compliance with specific regulations

**Considerations**:
- Requires infrastructure expertise
- Manual upgrade management
- Higher operational overhead
- Need to maintain availability and performance

**Use Cases**:
- On-premises data centers
- Private cloud deployments
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Custom infrastructure needs
- Air-gapped environments

**Minimum Requirements** (HA):
- 3 control plane nodes: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each
- 2+ worker nodes: 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each
- Shared storage or CSI driver

---

## SNO (Single-Node OpenShift)

**Type**: Self-managed, compact deployment

**Description**: OpenShift running on a single physical or virtual server, combining control plane and worker roles.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Single node serves as both control plane and worker
- Reduced footprint for resource-constrained environments
- Same OpenShift features as multi-node clusters
- No high-availability (single point of failure)

**Infrastructure Support**:
- Bare metal (physical servers)
- Virtual machines (VMware, KVM, etc.)
- Edge devices
- Platform value: **Always `none`** (no cloud provider integration)

**Management Responsibility**:
- ✅ You manage: Everything (same as OCP)
- ❌ Red Hat provides: Software updates, patches

**Advantages**:
- Minimal resource footprint
- Quick deployment (< 1 hour)
- Full OpenShift capabilities in compact form
- Ideal for edge locations
- Lower cost (single server)

**Considerations**:
- No high-availability (if node fails, cluster is down)
- Limited capacity for workloads
- Performance constraints with heavy workloads
- Not suitable for production critical workloads

**Minimum Requirements**:
- 8 vCPU (physical cores)
- 32 GB RAM
- 120 GB disk
- See [Host Requirements](./host-requirements.md) for details

**Use Cases**:
- Edge deployments (retail stores, factories, remote offices)
- Development and testing environments
- Proof-of-concept clusters
- Far edge with limited connectivity
- Single-tenant workloads

**Limitations**:
- No cluster-level HA
- Single node storage (no distributed storage)
- Limited scaling (vertical only, not horizontal)
- Some operators may require HA and won't work

---

## OSD (OpenShift Dedicated)

**Type**: Managed service

**Description**: Fully managed OpenShift clusters on AWS or GCP, managed by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SREs).

**Infrastructure Support**:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Management Responsibility**:
- ✅ Red Hat SREs manage: Infrastructure provisioning, cluster upgrades, monitoring, incident response, scaling
- ✅ You manage: Applications, user access, some cluster configurations

**Advantages**:
- Fully managed by Red Hat SREs
- 99.95% uptime SLA
- Automatic upgrades and patching
- 24/7 monitoring and support
- Focus on applications, not infrastructure

**Considerations**:
- Limited infrastructure customization
- Cloud provider costs (AWS/GCP)
- Red Hat subscription + cloud costs
- Less control over cluster configuration

**Use Cases**:
- Organizations wanting managed OpenShift
- Focus on development, not operations
- Need SLA guarantees
- Cloud-first strategy

**Cluster Sizes**:
- Production clusters: Minimum 3 control plane, 4 worker nodes
- Development clusters: Smaller footprints available
