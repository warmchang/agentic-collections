# /debug-inference Skill

Troubleshoot failed, stuck, or slow InferenceService deployments on Red Hat OpenShift AI. Performs progressive diagnosis through status conditions, events, pod logs, related resources, and optional observability analysis. Follows a 6-step diagnosis pattern with human-in-the-loop confirmation at each step.

## Prerequisites

**Required MCP Server**: `openshift` ([OpenShift MCP Server](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-mcp-server))

**Required MCP Tools** (from openshift):
- `resources_get` - Get ServingRuntime, NIM Account CR, InferenceService details
- `resources_list` - List InferenceServices (OpenShift fallback)
- `pods_list` - Find predictor/transformer pods
- `pods_log` - Retrieve container logs
- `events_list` - Check events for errors

**Preferred MCP Server**: `rhoai` ([RHOAI MCP Server](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rhoai-mcp)) — used when available, automatic OpenShift fallback on failure

**Preferred MCP Tools** (from rhoai):
- `list_inference_services` - List deployed models with structured status data
- `get_inference_service` - Get detailed deployment status (conditions, endpoint, ready state)
- `get_model_endpoint` - Quick check if endpoint is available (early diagnostic)

**Optional MCP Server**: `ai-observability` ([AI Observability MCP](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-observability-summarizer))

**Optional MCP Tools** (from ai-observability):
- `get_deployment_info` - Check model initialization status
- `analyze_vllm` - Analyze vLLM performance bottlenecks (latency, throughput, errors, token rates)
- `chat_vllm` - Conversational follow-up on vLLM metrics during diagnosis
- `get_gpu_info` - GPU inventory and utilization
- `analyze_openshift` - Check GPU health with "GPU & Accelerators" category
- `query_tempo_tool` - Trace request latency by service/operation/time range
- `get_trace_details_tool` - Get detailed span-level info for a specific trace ID
- `execute_promql` - Run custom PromQL queries for metrics not covered by standard analysis
- `korrel8r_get_correlated` - Correlate signals (logs, traces, metrics, alerts) across a pod/namespace for root cause analysis

**Common prerequisites** (KUBECONFIG, OpenShift+RHOAI cluster, KServe, verification protocol): See [skill-conventions.md](references/skill-conventions.md).

**Fallback templates**: See [openshift-fallback-templates.md](references/openshift-fallback-templates.md) for OpenShift YAML templates used when RHOAI tools are unavailable.

**Additional cluster requirements**:
- An existing InferenceService deployment to debug

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when you need to:**
- Troubleshoot an InferenceService that won't start, is stuck, or shows errors
- Diagnose slow inference latency or high error rates
- Investigate GPU scheduling failures or OOMKilled pods
- Perform root cause analysis on model deployment issues

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- You want to deploy a new model (use `/model-deploy`)
- You want to analyze ongoing model performance (use `/ai-observability`)
- You need to create or fix a ServingRuntime (use `/serving-runtime-config`)
- You need to set up NIM credentials (use `/nim-setup`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target InferenceService

**Ask the user:**
- Which InferenceService is having issues? (name or "list all")
- What namespace is it in?
- What is the symptom? (won't start / slow / errors / other)

If user says "list all" or is unsure:

**MCP Tool**: `list_inference_services` (from rhoai)

**Parameters**:
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `verbosity`: `"standard"` - OPTIONAL

**If rhoai unavailable or returns error**: Use `resources_list` (from openshift) with `apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1`, `kind: InferenceService`, `namespace: [namespace]`.

Present InferenceServices with their status:

| Name | Runtime | Ready | URL | Age |
|------|---------|-------|-----|-----|
| [name] | [runtime] | [True/False/Unknown] | [url or "N/A"] | [age] |

**WAIT for user to select which InferenceService to debug.**

### Step 2: Status Overview

**MCP Tool**: `get_inference_service` (from rhoai)

**Parameters**:
- `name`: the InferenceService name - REQUIRED
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `verbosity`: `"full"` - REQUIRED

**If rhoai unavailable or returns error**: Use `resources_get` (from openshift) with `apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1`, `kind: InferenceService`, `name: [name]`, `namespace: [namespace]`. Extract status from `.status.conditions`.

**Early endpoint check:**

**MCP Tool**: `get_model_endpoint` (from rhoai)
- `name`: the InferenceService name, `namespace`: user-specified namespace

**If rhoai unavailable or returns error**: Extract endpoint from `.status.url` of the InferenceService obtained via `resources_get` (from openshift).

An empty or error URL indicates deployment issues. Report endpoint availability status.

Present status conditions:

| Condition | Status | Reason | Message |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Ready | [True/False/Unknown] | [reason] | [message] |
| PredictorReady | [True/False/Unknown] | [reason] | [message] |
| IngressReady | [True/False/Unknown] | [reason] | [message] |

**Quick Assessment**: Based on conditions, provide initial assessment (e.g., "PredictorReady is False -- the model container is not running. Likely a pod-level issue.")

**Ask**: "Continue with deep analysis of events and pods? (yes/no)"

**WAIT for user confirmation.**

### Step 3: Events and Pod Analysis

**MCP Tool**: `events_list` (from openshift)

**Parameters**:
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED

Filter events related to the InferenceService name.

**MCP Tool**: `pods_list` (from openshift)

**Parameters**:
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `labelSelector`: `"serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=[isvc-name]"` - REQUIRED

Present findings:

**Events:**

| Time | Type | Reason | Message |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| [time] | [Normal/Warning] | [reason] | [message] |

**Predictor Pods:**

| Pod | Status | Restarts | Node | GPU |
|-----|--------|----------|------|-----|
| [pod-name] | [status] | [count] | [node] | [gpu-count] |

**Issues Found:**
- [Issue from events or pod status]

**Ask**: "Continue to view pod logs? (yes/no)"

**WAIT for user confirmation.**

### Step 4: Pod Logs Review

**MCP Tool**: `pods_log` (from openshift)

**Parameters**:
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `name`: predictor pod name from Step 3 - REQUIRED
- `container`: `"kserve-container"` - REQUIRED (main serving container)

If the container has restarted, also retrieve previous logs.

Present log analysis:

**Log Analysis:**
- [Error pattern identified, e.g., "CUDA out of memory", "S3 access denied", "Model not found"]
- [Relevant log line with explanation]

**For NIM-specific deployments**, also check:
- NGC authentication errors in logs
- TensorRT engine compilation status
- GPU compatibility messages

**If the error is unrecognized -> Trigger live doc lookup:**
1. **Action**: Read [live-doc-lookup.md](references/live-doc-lookup.md) using the Read tool
2. Use **WebFetch** to look up the error message in RHOAI documentation
3. **Output to user**: "I looked up this error on [source]: [explanation and fix]"

**Ask**: "Continue to check related resources and observability? (yes/no)"

**WAIT for user confirmation.**

### Step 5: Related Resources and Observability

**Check ServingRuntime:**

**MCP Tool**: `resources_get` (from openshift)

**Parameters**:
- `apiVersion`: `"serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1"` - REQUIRED
- `kind`: `"ServingRuntime"` - REQUIRED
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `name`: runtime name from the InferenceService spec - REQUIRED

Verify the runtime exists and its model format matches the InferenceService.

**For NIM deployments -- Check Account CR:**

**MCP Tool**: `resources_get` (from openshift)

**Parameters**:
- `apiVersion`: `"nim.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1"` - REQUIRED
- `kind`: `"Account"` - REQUIRED
- `namespace`: user-specified namespace - REQUIRED
- `name`: `"nim-account"` - REQUIRED

**If ai-observability MCP is available:**

- `get_deployment_info`: Check if the model appears in monitoring and its initialization status
- `analyze_vllm`: Analyze performance metrics for slow inference (latency, throughput, errors, token rates)
- `chat_vllm`: Ask follow-up questions about analyzed metrics (e.g., "Why is latency spiking?")
- `analyze_openshift` with category `"GPU & Accelerators"`: Check GPU health and utilization
- `query_tempo_tool`: Trace request latency if the symptom is slow responses
- `get_trace_details_tool`: Drill into a specific trace ID to see span-level timing
- `execute_promql`: Run custom PromQL queries for deeper metric investigation (e.g., `vllm:request_success:ratio`, GPU memory utilization)
- `korrel8r_get_correlated`: Correlate signals across the inference stack -- find related logs, traces, metrics, and alerts for the failing pod/namespace (query example: `k8s:Pod:{"namespace":"[ns]","name":"[pod-name]"}`, goals: `["log:application", "metric:metric", "trace:span"]`)

**If ai-observability not available**: Skip with note: "Observability analysis skipped (ai-observability MCP not configured)."

**Present findings:**
- ServingRuntime status and compatibility
- NIM Account CR status (if applicable)
- Observability insights (if available)

**Ask**: "Continue to diagnosis summary? (yes/no)"

**WAIT for user confirmation.**

### Step 6: Diagnosis Summary

Present a structured diagnosis:

```

```

**End with options:**

```
Would you like me to:
1. Execute a recommended fix
2. Dig deeper into a specific area
3. Debug a related resource (ServingRuntime, pod, NIM Account)
4. Invoke /serving-runtime-config to fix runtime issues
5. Exit debugging
```

**WAIT for user to select next action.**

## Common Issues

For common issues (GPU scheduling, OOMKilled, image pull errors, RBAC), see [common-issues.md](references/common-issues.md).

### Issue 1: S3 Storage Access Denied

**Error**: Pod logs show "Access Denied" or "NoSuchBucket" when loading model weights

**Cause**: S3 credentials are missing, expired, or the bucket/path is incorrect.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the `storageUri` in the InferenceService spec
2. Check that the S3 credential Secret exists in the namespace
3. Verify the Secret is referenced by the ServiceAccount or data connection
4. Test S3 access independently to confirm credentials are valid

### Issue 2: NIM Authentication / GPU Incompatibility

**Error**: NIM pod logs show NGC authentication failure, or TensorRT engine fails to compile for the available GPU

**Cause**: NGC API key is invalid/expired, or the GPU type is not supported by the NIM model profile.

**Solution:**
1. Check Account CR status for credential errors: `resources_get` for `accounts.nim.opendatahub.io`
2. Verify NGC API key is valid at https://ngc.nvidia.com
3. Check NIM supported GPU matrix via live doc lookup against [NVIDIA NIM supported models](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/supported-models.html)
4. Re-run `/nim-setup` to refresh credentials if expired

## Critical: Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

See [skill-conventions.md](references/skill-conventions.md) for general HITL and security conventions.

**Skill-specific checkpoints:**
- After identifying target (Step 1): confirm which InferenceService to debug
- After status overview (Step 2): confirm before deep analysis
- After events/pod analysis (Step 3): confirm before viewing logs
- After log review (Step 4): confirm before checking related resources
- After diagnosis summary (Step 6): present options, wait for user decision
- **NEVER** auto-delete or auto-modify InferenceService resources without user confirmation
- **NEVER** execute remediation actions without presenting the plan and getting explicit approval
