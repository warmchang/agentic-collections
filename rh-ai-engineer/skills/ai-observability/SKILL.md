# /ai-observability Skill

Analyze AI model inference performance, GPU utilization, OpenShift cluster health, and distributed traces on Red Hat OpenShift AI. This is a query-driven, read-only skill: the user asks a question, and the skill routes to the appropriate observability domain (vLLM metrics, OpenShift health, Tempo traces, or cross-domain correlation via Korrel8r).

## Prerequisites

**Required MCP Server**: `ai-observability` ([AI Observability MCP](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-observability-summarizer))

**Required MCP Tools**:
- `list_models` (from ai-observability) - Discover served models
- `list_vllm_namespaces` (from ai-observability) - List monitored namespaces
- `get_gpu_info` (from ai-observability) - GPU inventory and utilization
- `get_deployment_info` (from ai-observability) - Deployment health status
- `analyze_vllm` (from ai-observability) - Model performance analysis
- `chat_vllm` (from ai-observability) - Conversational follow-up on vLLM metrics
- `analyze_openshift` (from ai-observability) - Cluster/namespace health metrics
- `list_openshift_metric_groups` (from ai-observability) - Available metric categories

**Optional MCP Server**: `rhoai` ([RHOAI MCP Server](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rhoai-mcp))

**Optional MCP Tools** (from rhoai):
- `list_data_science_projects` - Discover RHOAI projects for scope selection
- `list_inference_services` - List deployed models with structured status for context
- `get_inference_service` - Get InferenceService status for context

**If rhoai is unavailable or returns errors**: Use `openshift` tools as fallback — `resources_list` with `apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1`, `kind: InferenceService` replaces `list_inference_services`; `resources_list` with `apiVersion: v1`, `kind: Namespace`, `labelSelector: opendatahub.io/dashboard=true` replaces `list_data_science_projects`.

**Optional MCP Server**: `openshift` ([OpenShift MCP Server](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-mcp-server))

**Optional MCP Tools** (from openshift):
- `resources_get` (from openshift) - Get raw resource details for context
- `resources_list` (from openshift) - List InferenceServices, Namespaces (fallback for rhoai tools)
- `pods_list` (from openshift) - List predictor pods for correlation context

**Common prerequisites** (KUBECONFIG, OpenShift+RHOAI cluster, verification protocol): See [skill-conventions.md](references/skill-conventions.md).

**Additional environment variables**:
- `AI_OBSERVABILITY_MCP_URL` - URL for the AI Observability MCP server (e.g., `http://aiobs-mcp.apps.cluster.example.com`)

**Additional cluster requirements**:
- AI Observability MCP server deployed on-cluster (from `quay.io/ecosystem-appeng/aiobs-mcp-server`)
- Prometheus configured with vLLM and OpenShift metrics
- Tempo configured for distributed tracing (optional, for trace analysis)
- Korrel8r deployed (optional, for cross-domain correlation)

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when you need to:**
- Check model inference performance (latency, throughput, error rates)
- View GPU inventory and utilization across the cluster
- Analyze OpenShift cluster health metrics by category
- Trace slow inference requests with distributed tracing (Tempo)
- Correlate signals across logs, metrics, traces, and alerts (Korrel8r)
- Run custom PromQL queries against cluster Prometheus

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- You need to troubleshoot a failed deployment (use `/debug-inference`)
- You want to deploy or redeploy a model (use `/model-deploy`)
- You need to create or modify a ServingRuntime (use `/serving-runtime-config`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify MCP and Triage Intent

**Verify ai-observability MCP server is reachable.** If any tool call fails with a connection error:

```
Cannot execute /ai-observability: ai-observability MCP server is not reachable.

Setup Instructions:
1. Deploy the server on your cluster from quay.io/ecosystem-appeng/aiobs-mcp-server
   See: https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-observability-summarizer
2. Set AI_OBSERVABILITY_MCP_URL to the server route URL
3. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers

Options: setup (show deployment guide) / abort
```

**WAIT for user decision if MCP is unavailable.**

**Classify user query** into one of these domains:

| Domain | Trigger Phrases | Primary Tool(s) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Model Discovery | "what models", "list models", "what's deployed" | `list_models`, `list_vllm_namespaces` |
| GPU Inventory | "GPU", "GPU utilization", "what GPUs", "available hardware" | `get_gpu_info` |
| vLLM Performance | "latency", "throughput", "performance", "how is [model]", "slow" | `analyze_vllm` |
| OpenShift Health | "cluster health", "namespace metrics", "node health", "pods" | `analyze_openshift` |
| Tracing | "trace", "latency trace", "slow request", "spans" | `query_tempo_tool` |
| Correlation | "correlate", "root cause", "what's related to" | `korrel8r_get_correlated` |
| Custom PromQL | "PromQL", "custom query", "specific metric" | `execute_promql` |

If the intent is ambiguous, present the domain options and ask the user to choose.

If the user specifies a model name, use `list_models` first to verify it exists and get the correct identifier. If the user does not specify a namespace, use `list_vllm_namespaces` or `list_openshift_namespaces` to discover available namespaces and present them.

**Project context** (if `rhoai` MCP available): For "what's running" or "what's deployed" queries, use `list_data_science_projects` (from rhoai) to provide project-level overview. Use `list_inference_services` (from rhoai) per project to show deployed models with status.

**WAIT for user to confirm scope before proceeding to analysis.**

### Step 3: Follow-Up and Drill-Down

After presenting initial results, offer domain-appropriate follow-up options:

- For vLLM analysis: use `chat_vllm` for conversational follow-up
- For traces: allow drilling into specific trace IDs via `get_trace_details_tool`
- For correlation: allow drilling into correlated signals
- For any domain: offer to switch to a different analysis domain

Present options and **WAIT for user decision**. Options always include an "Exit analysis" choice.

### Step 4: Summary and Next Steps

When the user chooses to exit:

Summarize key findings from the analysis session.

**If issues were found**, suggest:
- `/debug-inference` for deployment or pod-level problems
- `/model-deploy` to redeploy with different configuration
- Custom PromQL queries for ongoing monitoring

**If everything looks healthy**, confirm: "All monitored metrics are within normal ranges."

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: AI Observability MCP Server Not Deployed

**Error**: Connection refused or timeout when reaching `AI_OBSERVABILITY_MCP_URL`

**Cause**: The AI Observability MCP server is not deployed on the cluster, or the route/service is not accessible.

**Solution:**
1. Deploy the server from `quay.io/ecosystem-appeng/aiobs-mcp-server` -- see https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-observability-summarizer
2. Verify the route is accessible: `oc get route -n [namespace] aiobs-mcp`
3. Set `AI_OBSERVABILITY_MCP_URL` to the route URL
4. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers

### Issue 2: No Models Found in Monitoring

**Error**: `list_models` returns empty results

**Cause**: vLLM metrics are not being scraped by Prometheus, or no InferenceServices are deployed.

**Solution:**
1. Verify InferenceServices exist: use `resources_list` from `openshift` MCP
2. Check that Prometheus ServiceMonitor is configured for vLLM metrics
3. Verify the vLLM serving container exposes `/metrics` endpoint

### Issue 3: Tempo Traces Not Available

**Error**: `query_tempo_tool` returns empty or connection error

**Cause**: Tempo is not deployed, or distributed tracing is not configured for the inference stack.

**Solution:**
1. Verify Tempo is deployed in the cluster
2. Check OpenTelemetry instrumentation on the inference endpoints
3. Verify Tempo datasource is configured in the MCP server

### Issue 4: Korrel8r Correlation Returns No Results

**Error**: `korrel8r_get_correlated` returns empty correlation

**Cause**: Korrel8r is not deployed, or the query format is incorrect.

**Solution:**
1. Verify Korrel8r is deployed and accessible
2. Check the query format matches Korrel8r domain syntax (e.g., `k8s:Pod:{"namespace":"[ns]","name":"[pod]"}`)
3. Ensure the target pod/namespace exists and has generated observability signals

## Critical: Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

See [skill-conventions.md](references/skill-conventions.md) for general HITL and security conventions.

**Skill-specific checkpoints:**
- After triage (Step 1): confirm analysis scope (model, namespace, time range) before running queries
- After initial analysis (Step 2): present follow-up options, wait for user choice
- After correlation (Step 2f): confirm before drilling into correlated signals
- **NEVER** expose raw Prometheus/Tempo credentials or internal cluster endpoints in output
- **NEVER** execute unbounded PromQL queries (no time limit, extremely wide label selectors) without confirming with the user
