# CVSS Scoring and Red Hat Severity Mappings

This document explains CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scoring and how Red Hat maps CVSS scores to severity ratings for prioritization.

## Overview

**CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** is an industry-standard framework for assessing vulnerability severity. Red Hat uses **CVSS v3.1** for all vulnerabilities published since 2016.

**Key Concepts**:
- **CVSS Base Score**: 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (critical) - measures inherent vulnerability characteristics
- **CVSS Temporal Score**: Adjusts base score for current exploit availability
- **CVSS Environmental Score**: Organization-specific adjustments
- **Red Hat Severity**: Critical/Important/Moderate/Low - Red Hat's assessment for their products

**Important**: Red Hat severity ratings may differ from CVSS scores based on real-world exploitability in RHEL environments.

## CVSS v3.1 Metrics

CVSS base scores are calculated from 8 metrics across 3 categories:

### Exploitability Metrics (How Easy to Exploit)

#### 1. Attack Vector (AV)
**Question**: How is the vulnerability exploited?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Network (N)** | Highest | Remotely exploitable over network | Web service vulnerability |
| **Adjacent (A)** | High | Exploitable from adjacent network | WiFi attack, same subnet |
| **Local (L)** | Medium | Requires local access to system | Privilege escalation |
| **Physical (P)** | Lowest | Requires physical access | Console-only exploit |

**Impact on Priority**: Network vulnerabilities are highest priority (remotely exploitable).

#### 2. Attack Complexity (AC)
**Question**: How difficult is the attack to execute?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Low (L)** | Higher | Easy to exploit reliably | Standard buffer overflow |
| **High (H)** | Lower | Requires specific conditions | Race condition, timing-dependent |

**Impact on Priority**: Low complexity = easier exploitation = higher priority.

#### 3. Privileges Required (PR)
**Question**: What privileges must attacker have?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **None (N)** | Highest | Unauthenticated attack | Public web service exploit |
| **Low (L)** | Medium | Basic user privileges needed | Authenticated user exploit |
| **High (H)** | Lowest | Admin/root privileges needed | Root-only privilege escalation |

**Impact on Priority**: None required = widest attack surface = highest priority.

#### 4. User Interaction (UI)
**Question**: Does exploitation require user action?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **None (N)** | Higher | Fully automated | Wormable exploit |
| **Required (R)** | Lower | User must perform action | Phishing, clicking malicious link |

**Impact on Priority**: No interaction = self-propagating = highest priority.

### Scope Metric

#### 5. Scope (S)
**Question**: Can the exploit impact resources beyond the vulnerable component?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Changed (C)** | Higher | Impacts other components | Container escape, VM escape |
| **Unchanged (U)** | Lower | Impacts only vulnerable component | Single service compromise |

**Impact on Priority**: Changed scope = broader impact = higher priority.

### Impact Metrics (What Damage)

#### 6. Confidentiality (C)
**Question**: How much data can be disclosed?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **High (H)** | 0.56 | Total information disclosure | Database dump, /etc/shadow leak |
| **Low (L)** | 0.22 | Limited disclosure | Single file read |
| **None (N)** | 0.00 | No confidentiality impact | Denial of service only |

#### 7. Integrity (I)
**Question**: How much can data/systems be modified?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **High (H)** | 0.56 | Total data modification | Root access, arbitrary code execution |
| **Low (L)** | 0.22 | Limited modification | Single file write |
| **None (N)** | 0.00 | No integrity impact | Read-only exploit |

#### 8. Availability (A)
**Question**: How much is service availability impacted?

| Value | Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **High (H)** | 0.56 | Total service disruption | System crash, complete DoS |
| **Low (L)** | 0.22 | Reduced performance | Resource exhaustion, slowdown |
| **None (N)** | 0.00 | No availability impact | Information disclosure only |

## CVSS Score Calculation

### Base Score Formula

The CVSS v3.1 base score is calculated using a complex formula:

```
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]

If Scope Unchanged:
  BaseScore = Roundup(Minimum[(Impact + Exploitability), 10])

If Scope Changed:
  BaseScore = Roundup(Minimum[1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10])

Where:
Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI
```

**You don't need to calculate manually** - use CVSS calculators:
- FIRST CVSS Calculator: https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1
- Red Hat CVE pages include calculated scores

### CVSS Severity Ratings (FIRST Standard)

| CVSS Score | Severity | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | **Critical** | Easily exploitable, severe impact |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | **High** | Exploitable with moderate effort, significant impact |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | **Medium** | Requires specific conditions, moderate impact |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | **Low** | Difficult to exploit, limited impact |
| 0.0 | **None** | No impact |

## Red Hat Severity Ratings

Red Hat uses a **4-point severity scale** that may differ from CVSS:

### Red Hat Severity Levels

| Severity | Typical CVSS Range | Description | Response Time | Example |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Easily exploitable, widespread impact, remote code execution | 24-48 hours | Heartbleed, Shellshock |
| **Important** | 7.0-8.9 | Exploitable, significant impact, requires moderate effort | 7 days | Privilege escalation, data leak |
| **Moderate** | 4.0-6.9 | Requires specific conditions, limited scope | 30 days | Local DoS, limited info disclosure |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Difficult to exploit, minimal impact | 90 days | Minor information leaks |

### Why Red Hat Severity ≠ CVSS Score

Red Hat Product Security considers additional factors:

**Exploitability in Real World**:
- Is the vulnerable code path actually used in typical RHEL deployments?
- Are default RHEL configurations vulnerable?
- Do RHEL security features (SELinux, firewall) mitigate the vulnerability?

**Example 1: CVSS Higher Than Red Hat Severity**
```
CVE: CVE-2024-XXXX
CVSS Score: 8.5 (High)
Red Hat Severity: Moderate

Reason:
- Vulnerability requires non-default configuration
- Feature rarely enabled in production RHEL systems
- SELinux blocks exploitation in enforcing mode
- Red Hat downgrades to Moderate based on real-world risk
```

**Example 2: Red Hat Severity Higher Than CVSS**
```
CVE: CVE-2024-YYYY
CVSS Score: 6.5 (Medium)
Red Hat Severity: Important

Reason:
- CVSS calculated for generic software
- In RHEL context, vulnerability is more exploitable
- Commonly used RHEL service affected
- Red Hat elevates to Important based on customer environment
```

## Priority Decision Matrix

Combine Red Hat severity with other factors to determine priority:

### Priority Calculation

| Red Hat Severity | Vulnerable Status | Production System | Known Exploit | Priority | Response |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Critical | Vulnerable | Yes | Yes | **P0** | 24 hours |
| Critical | Vulnerable | Yes | No | **P0** | 48 hours |
| Critical | Vulnerable | No | - | **P1** | 7 days |
| Important | Vulnerable | Yes | Yes | **P1** | 7 days |
| Important | Vulnerable | Yes | No | **P1** | 14 days |
| Important | Vulnerable | No | - | **P2** | 30 days |
| Moderate | Vulnerable | Yes | - | **P2** | 30 days |
| Moderate | Vulnerable | No | - | **P3** | 90 days |
| Low | Vulnerable | - | - | **P3** | 90 days |
| Any | Affected but not vulnerable | - | - | **P3** | Next maintenance window |

### Decision Tree

```
1. What is Red Hat Severity?
   ├─ Critical → Continue to 2
   ├─ Important → Continue to 2
   ├─ Moderate → P2 (unless production + exploit = P2)
   └─ Low → P3

2. Is system Vulnerable or Affected but not vulnerable?
   ├─ Vulnerable → Continue to 3
   └─ Affected but not vulnerable → P3

3. Is this a production system?
   ├─ Yes → Continue to 4
   └─ No → P1 (Critical) or P2 (Important)

4. Is exploit known/available?
   ├─ Yes → P0
   └─ No → P0 (Critical) or P1 (Important)
```

## CVSS Vector String

CVSS scores include a **vector string** encoding all metrics:

**Example Vector String**:
```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
```

**Decoded**:
- **AV:N** - Attack Vector: Network
- **AC:L** - Attack Complexity: Low
- **PR:N** - Privileges Required: None
- **UI:N** - User Interaction: None
- **S:C** - Scope: Changed
- **C:H** - Confidentiality Impact: High
- **I:H** - Integrity Impact: High
- **A:H** - Availability Impact: High

**Score**: 10.0 (Critical)

**Interpretation**: Remotely exploitable, no authentication, no user interaction, impacts all CIA aspects - **highest severity**.

## Common CVE Patterns

- C:N/I:N/A:H (Availability only)

**CVSS Score**: 7.5
**Red Hat Severity**: Moderate (unless critical service)

**Priority**: P2 - 30 days (unless high-availability requirement)

## Compliance Framework Mappings

### PCI-DSS Requirements

**PCI-DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.3.3**: Patch critical and high vulnerabilities within defined timeframes

| CVSS Score | PCI-DSS Timeline | Remediation Deadline |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 9.0-10.0 (Critical) | Within 30 days | **30 days max** |
| 7.0-8.9 (High) | Within 30 days | **30 days max** |
| 4.0-6.9 (Medium) | Risk-based approach | Organization-defined |
| 0.1-3.9 (Low) | Risk-based approach | Organization-defined |

**Compliance Note**: PCI-DSS uses CVSS scores, not Red Hat severity ratings.

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

**CC7.1**: Detect and respond to security incidents

- **All CVSS 7.0+**: Must be tracked, remediated, documented
- **Remediation process**: Must demonstrate timely response
- **Audit trail**: Document priority decisions and remediation timeline

### NIST 800-53

**SI-2**: Flaw Remediation

- **High-impact systems**: Remediate high/critical within 30 days
- **Moderate-impact**: Remediate within 60 days
- **Low-impact**: Remediate within 90 days

Map CVSS to NIST impact:
- CVSS 9.0-10.0 → High impact
- CVSS 7.0-8.9 → Moderate impact
- CVSS < 7.0 → Low impact

## Integration with Remediation Agent

### CVE Impact Skill Workflow

```yaml
# Step 1: Retrieve CVE data (use vulnerability-logic.md)
- Get CVSS score from Red Hat Lightspeed
- Get Red Hat severity rating
- Check vulnerable vs affected status

# Step 2: Interpret CVSS (use THIS document)
- Understand CVSS metrics (AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A)
- Map CVSS to Red Hat severity
- Check for discrepancies (explain to user)

# Step 3: Calculate priority (use THIS document)
- Apply priority decision matrix
- Consider: severity + vulnerable status + production + exploit
- Output: P0/P1/P2/P3 with reasoning

# Step 4: Recommend action
- P0: Immediate remediation (use cve-remediation-templates.md)
- P1: Schedule within 7 days
- P2: Next maintenance window
- P3: Backlog
```

### Remediator Agent Integration

```yaml
# Input from CVE Impact Skill:
priority: P0
cvss_score: 9.8
red_hat_severity: Critical
reasoning: "Network RCE, no auth required, production systems affected"

# Remediator Agent Decision:
if priority == "P0":
  - Generate playbook immediately (Template 1 or 4)
  - Recommend emergency change process
  - Execute with minimal delay

if priority == "P1":
  - Generate playbook
  - Schedule maintenance window
  - Allow time for testing in staging

if priority == "P2" or "P3":
  - Add to remediation backlog
  - Batch with other low-priority CVEs
  - Include in next quarterly patching cycle
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Trust Red Hat Severity Over Raw CVSS

Red Hat Product Security analyzes vulnerabilities in the context of RHEL systems. Their severity ratings account for:
- Default RHEL configurations
- SELinux policies
- Firewall defaults
- Real-world usage patterns

✅ **Use Red Hat severity for prioritization decisions**
⚠️ CVSS is a helpful reference but not the sole factor

### 2. Document Prioritization Decisions

Create an audit trail:
```markdown
CVE-2024-XXXX Prioritization Decision
Date: 2024-01-15
CVSS Score: 8.5 (High)
Red Hat Severity: Moderate
Assigned Priority: P2

Rationale:
- CVSS high due to network vector
- Red Hat downgraded to Moderate (non-default config required)
- No active exploitation detected
- Non-production systems only affected
- Decision: P2 (30-day remediation window)

Approved by: [Security Team Lead]
```

### 3. Re-evaluate on New Information

Priorities can change:
- **Exploit published**: P2 → P1
- **Active exploitation**: Any → P0
- **Configuration change**: Affected but not vulnerable → Vulnerable

Set up alerts for CVE status changes.

### 4. Communicate in Business Terms

Translate CVSS for stakeholders:

**For Technical Teams**:
```
CVE-2024-XXXX: CVSS 9.8 (Critical)
Attack Vector: Network, No Auth Required
Impact: Remote Code Execution
Priority: P0 - Patch within 24 hours
```

**For Management**:
```
CVE-2024-XXXX: Critical Severity
Risk: Attackers can remotely compromise our web servers
Business Impact: Customer data exposure, service outage
Action Required: Emergency patching tonight
Estimated Downtime: 30 minutes per server
```

## Quick Reference

### CVSS to Red Hat Severity (Typical Mapping)

| CVSS Range | Red Hat Severity | Priority | Response Time |
|------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | P0 | 24-48 hours |
| 7.0-8.9 | Important | P1 | 7 days |
| 4.0-6.9 | Moderate | P2 | 30 days |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | P3 | 90 days |

**Note**: Actual Red Hat severity may differ - always check CVE page.

### Priority Override Conditions

Escalate priority if:
- **Active exploitation** detected (any severity → P0)
- **Production critical system** affected (+1 priority level)
- **Compliance deadline** approaching (adjust to meet deadline)
- **Wormable vulnerability** (self-propagating → P0)

Downgrade priority if:
- **Affected but not vulnerable** (-1 priority level)
- **Non-production only** (-1 priority level)
- **Compensating controls** in place (-1 priority level)
