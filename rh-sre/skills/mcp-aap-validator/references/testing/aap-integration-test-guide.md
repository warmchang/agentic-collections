## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "AAP MCP Validation Failed"

**Symptoms**: Validation fails with connection errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `AAP_MCP_SERVER` environment variable is correct (must point to the MCP endpoint of the AAP server)
2. Check API token is valid and not expired
3. Ensure AAP server is accessible from your network
4. Review AAP MCP server logs for errors

### Issue: "No Job Templates Found"

**Symptoms**: Validation passes but no templates available

**Solutions**:
1. Create job template via AAP Web UI
2. Ensure project is synced and contains playbooks
3. Verify inventory is configured
4. Check credentials are attached to template

### Issue: "Dry-Run Shows No Changes"

**Symptoms**: Dry-run completes but reports 0 changes

**Solutions**:
1. Verify systems actually need remediation
2. Check playbook targets correct hosts
3. Ensure package names are correct
4. Review playbook conditionals (when clauses)

### Issue: "Execution Hangs"

**Symptoms**: Job starts but never completes

**Solutions**:
1. Check AAP Web UI for job status
2. Review job output for stuck tasks
3. Verify systems are reachable
